I learned a lot, and most importantly I HAVE to get started earlier.

----
I assume:

- Employee Class
  - Will need a method to convert to whole dollars
- Saleman Class
  - Will need a calculation method to calculate modified salary
- Will need a file reader class
- File will be set up as described
- File will contain no more than 500 entries

****** Main Design Decisions

Salary is to be specified as whole dollars, so I am going to use ~int~ as the data type since I do not have to worry about decimals, and ~int~ is faster (I think).

Stock price precision is not specified, so since this is for an executive salary I will default to choosing the most accurate data type, within reason in the context of this project. I think a double is fine in this instance.

Salarys are ints, my interperetation of "whole dollar"


I am learning excruitatingly that testing can be automated, because the code is repeating, but I can't justify writing more efficient testing tools while I still have to finish writing the main program.

I am adding getters and setters for everythign as makes sense. Maybe at the end I can run coverage and remove unused methods.

Using ~split()~ to tokenize because the docs reccommend it.
